# """
# TypeSense collection lifecycle — schema definition, creation, inspection.

# This module is the SINGLE source of truth for the `facilities` collection
# schema. If a field is not declared here it does not exist in the index, and
# `facility_mapper` must not emit it (TypeSense would silently drop it, which is
# worse than an error because the field just quietly stops working).

# Design notes that are not obvious from the code:

# * Every field except `id`, `name` and `rating_sort` is `optional: true`. That is
#   not defensiveness — it comes straight from the source table, where 96 of 98
#   columns are nullable `text` and most rows have large gaps. A non-optional
#   field in TypeSense causes the WHOLE document to be rejected at import time
#   when the value is missing, so one over-strict field would silently drop tens
#   of thousands of facilities.

# * `rating_sort` exists purely so `default_sorting_field` has something valid to
#   point at. TypeSense requires that field to be a non-optional int32/float, and
#   `overall_rating` is empty for the vast majority of rows. `rating_sort` is
#   always emitted (0.0 when unrated), which also reproduces Postgres's
#   `ORDER BY overall_rating DESC NULLS LAST` exactly.

# * `overall_rating` is kept as a SEPARATE optional field even though it
#   duplicates `rating_sort`. The mobile app hides the rating row when the value
#   is null; if we collapsed the two and shipped 0.0, every unrated facility
#   would render a 0-star rating. Display value and sort value have genuinely
#   different semantics here.

# MODULE NOTE — adding geo radius search later (Phase 2)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# To support "facilities within N miles", add:
#     {"name": "location", "type": "geopoint", "optional": True}
# and have the mapper emit `[lat, lng]` ONLY when both coordinates parse and
# fall in valid ranges. TypeSense cannot filter by radius across two separate
# float fields, so the dedicated geopoint is required.
#
# Adding a field to a live collection is an ALTER (client.collections[n].update)
# and does not drop existing documents — but existing documents will not gain
# the new field until they are re-imported. Budget a full 60k reindex for it.
